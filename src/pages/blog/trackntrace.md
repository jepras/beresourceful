### Willingness to collaborate

Throughout the 2 day workshop I noticed a strong desire to change the construction industry. The participants came with a wish to solve their work problems, but they all also had a personal motivation to make the construction industry more sustainable

Smith Innovation did a great job guiding us through the process of narrowing down our sporadic ambitious thoughts into a pilot project that can test a variant of our vision

‍‍

At the end of the 2 days we had gathered all the insights from the problem owners (Velux, Zublin & Rockwool) and distilled that into a solution. From that we created a pitch, product interface drafts, budget proposal, data models & a schedule

‍‍

If everything goes well, then will we start to see the first seeds be planted towards a more circular construction industry over the next months..
