2 days they had flown futuristic crazy entrepreneurs from all over the world to educate us on the future of work, space, food and more.

As a part of the event they had accepted 50 exponential startups & scaleups working on the world biggest issues to connect them with industry leaders and shown them how people take action outside the big corporations.

SingularityU Nordic must have seen potential in our idea as we were one of the lucky ones chosen to pitch!
