### The usual suspects

For the average resident it seems like moisture damages happen completely random. It is not as random as it might seem at first glance. At least not to experienced building inspectors.

Preben Gramstrup from fm3.dk wrote in his report on digital opportunities to better use existing buildings that 15-20 sensors would be enough to cover for the biggest external leakages.

Because it does happen at the same places over and over again. It happens around the chimney, the window rafters, the drain pipes - over and over again.

Below is an example from a customer where we in 30 seconds show placements of some of the most vulnerable areas.

As we set up our sensors in customers buildings we always bring in an expert to identify the vulnerable areas so you are ensured the sensors will pick the damages that may occur in your building.
